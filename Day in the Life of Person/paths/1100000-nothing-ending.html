            You decide to lay in bed for a small bit longer, not to sleep, not to rest, just to sit there.
            <br> A few seconds turn to minutes turn to hours.
            <br> You continue to lay in bed, not doing anything, not thinking about anything.
            <br> You haven't died, but are you dead if you haven't truly lived.
            <br> Hours turn to days turn to weeks.
            <br> No one has come knock at the door.
            <br> Weeks turn to months turn to years.
            <br> You start to merge with the bed, there's no knowing where the you begins and the bed ends.
            <br> You think for the first time in a decade...
            <br> "I need to use the bathroom."
            <br> The End.
