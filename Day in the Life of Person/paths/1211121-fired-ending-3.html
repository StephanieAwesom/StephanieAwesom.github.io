            You obviously don't want to ignore your boss' orders, so you sit at the suggested seat.
            Time seems to slow as you slowly inch your butt towards the cushion below.
            As you notice the smile spread across your boss' face, you realize that it's no ordinary cushion...
            It's a whoopee cushion...
            You brace for the inevitable, and time suddenly speeds back up.
            Pfffffffffffffffffffffft.
            You speak up for the first time today, "I guess I've just been..."
            Your head immediately explodes in embarassment, and you die instantly.
            "Fired..."
            <br> Then your body does a cool 180 and the camera does a close-up of your rotting corpse (now with sunglasses) as explosions go off in the background.
