            You know exactly what must be done, and excitedly decide to cross the road!
            <br> There's no reason to cross the road, there isn't a shortcut to take, no shop to be distracted by, and it's not on the work route.
            <br> But in order to spice things up, the most crazy, unimaginable, psychotic things must be done.
            <br> You quickly scan both ends of the road for any cars, nothing is there.
            <br> Excited with the prospects of what this new thinking could bring, you rush over to the pavement on the other side.
            <br> Uh oh... tragedy strikes!
            <br> In your excitement, you fail to take the proper procautions and trip on the curb.
            <br> Life suddenly slows as you think about everything that lead to this moment... the triumphs, the failures, the everyday normalities.
            <br> You think about the good times, the bad times, and the ugly times.
            <br> "Haha, I remember that one time.. or that one other time! Oh my god, I completely forgot about that one thing that happened."
            <br> All of a sudden, time speeds back up.
            <br> Your eyes close, expecting to feel the sweet release of death.
            <br> ...
            <br> ...
            <br> ...
            <br> Your eyes open.
            <br> What greets you is something unexpected.
            <br> An empty room connected to more empty rooms and hallways that extend to an unconventional length.
            <br> The walls filled with an ugly greenish-yellow pattern.
            <br> The ceiling tiled, with lights perfectly spaced out to seemingly no end, flickering at an uneasyily consistent rate.
            <br> You have reached the end...
