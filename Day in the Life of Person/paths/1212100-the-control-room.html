            You decide to push the big green button, as it looked quite nice.
            <br> This opens up a passageway on one side of the room.
            <br> The passageway leads to a long, dark hallway, and you're quite afraid to enter, but you gather together all of the courage within you and start making your down the hall.
            <br> Minutes pass before you see something other than pitch black darkness, it's a light, at the end of the tunnel.
            <br> "Wow, I guess I've died" You think to yourself.
            <br> But this was no death you have experienced, instead, the light is coming from a control room.
            <br> "Omg, it must be a shark monitoring control room!!!!"
            <br> The door to the control room is wide open, so you enter and have a look around.
            <br> Most of the monitors are broken besides one in the middle of the room.
            <br> On the monitor is a strange-looking person sitting in a perfectly clean, white room.
            <br> The person has bright, green skin, they're wearing an orange jumpsuit, their head is half the size of the average person's, and their limbs have uneven lengths.
            <br> That ain't no shark...
            <br> You notice the buttons below the monitor.
            <br> "eat"
            <br> "sleep"
            <br> "game"
            <br> "repeat"
            <br> And finally, "release"
            <br> You don't know why, but you can't help but feel a connection to this strange, green being.
            <br> Being trapped in a box, having your every decision out of your control, for some reason the situation feels familiar.

        <p>Which button will your press?</p>
