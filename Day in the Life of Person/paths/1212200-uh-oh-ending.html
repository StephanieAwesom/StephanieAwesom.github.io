            You press the big, red button with the image of a bomb, why? Because surely this can't be an actual bomb.
            <br> Then you hear a voice booming throughout the entire facility.
            <br> "10"
            <br> "9"
            <br> "8"
            <br> "7"
            <br> "6"
            <br> Uh oh, you might have messed up.
            <br> "5"
            <br> But surely this is just a prank, right?
            <br> "4"
            <br> There is absolutely no way an actual bomb is about to go off, right?
            <br> "3"
            <br> Just then, all of your troubles were answered as you head back outside of the building and look up.
            <br> "2"
            <br> There it was.
            <br> "1"
            <br> A giant nuke.
            <br> The End.
