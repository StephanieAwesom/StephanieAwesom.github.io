            You throw yourself at the shark, leaping all across the room, and you thread the gap that is the shark's mouth.
            <br> Suddenly, the shark starts speaking.
            <br> "It pains me to say this, but you've just been "
            <br> The shark chomps down onto you, and you die instantly.

            <br> Then the shark does a cool 180 and the camera does a close-up of his face (now with sunglasses) as explosions go off in the background.
