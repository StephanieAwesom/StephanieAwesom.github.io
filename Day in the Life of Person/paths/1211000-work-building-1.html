            You decide to ignore the mystery building and continue to work.
            <br> After entering the office building you greet your fellow co-workers and immediately get to work.
            <br> A couple hours pass of tippying and tappying on the computer's keyboard, when suddenly your boss appears in front of your desk.
            <br> "Placeholder, you've been working here for a couple months now, and you're a good worker. I think it's time I've shown you something, follow me."
            <br> You follow him as he leads you all the way to the top floor of the building, the boss' office.
            <br> Inside it looks like a standard office room, but one thing is noticeably different.
            <br> In the back of the room is a large sheet blocking the view from the back window.
            <br> "Placeholder... I know this looks like a standard office room, but there's one thing different you may have noticed. This large sheet that blocks the view from the back window. Behind here, is the largest secret this company knows... are you ready?"
            <br> Your nerves start to kick in, what could possibly be behind that sheet... OMG IT'S GONNA BE AN AWESOME SHARK ISN'T IT!!! (A/N Placeholder loves sharks.)
