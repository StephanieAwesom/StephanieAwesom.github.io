        <p>
            You ignore the boss' orders and take your own path in life.
            <br> The seat next to the suggested chair meets its maker as you plop yourself onto of it.
            <br> You notice your boss start to sweat profusely.
            <br> Slowly but surely he sits down in his unintended spot.
            <br> A light but long pfft can be heard all throughout the room.
            <br> That's when you notice it...
            <br> Underneath your boss's buttocks lies the whoopiest of cushions.
            <br> His face brightens to a tomato-ish red.
            <br> The embarassment is too much to bare and he dies, and with no witnesses, you decide to make yourself the new head of the company.
