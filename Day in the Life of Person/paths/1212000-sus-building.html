            Your curiosity gets the better of you, and you decide to ditch work to check out whatever is going on in this suspicious-looking establishment.
            <br> The 'DO NOT ENTER' sign's flashing red shines onto your face as you look up at the building in amazement.
            <br> You open the door and it creaks.
            <br> Upon entering, the door mysteriously shuts without aid which gives you a little fright, but you think nothing of it.
            <br> With the door closed, you're left in pitch blackness, that is until a bright light suddenly turns on.
            <br> Ahead of you lies a large room, it is entirely empty except for one table sitting in the middle.
            <br> Atop this piece of furniture are three buttons.
            <br> One is green with an image of two stick figures holding hands.
            <br> Another is red with an image of a bomb.
            <br> The final button is blue and displays an image of current (2023) president of the United States, Joe Biden.
            <br> A note lies above the buttons, you pick it up and read it aloud, even though no-one else is here.
            <br> "Placeholder, you have had an incredible jourey, you have made choices beyond my comprehension, or perhaps, you haven't. Either way, this choice is your last, it's your first, it's your middle. Break free from the shackles and decide your own path, create your own journey, seal your own fate. Lots of love, mysterious note xoxo"

        <p>Which button will you press?</p>
